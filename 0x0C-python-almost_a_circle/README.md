## Background Context
The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level Alx curriculum. This project is meant to help me be ready for it.

In this project, I reviewed everything about Python:

* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file

I also learned about:

* <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code>
* Serialization/Deserialization
* JSON

## Resources
* (args/kwargs)[https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/7gc6UzxSL81HcuAwklUbuQ]
* (JSON encoder and decoder)[https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rGVU9mt57rVURGnjK6n4_Q]
* (unittest module)[https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/soictNXCPE18ASL3INoeew]
* (Python test cheatsheet)[https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/uI9iskBCcNo5pc7j9Vy86A]

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
#### Python Unit Tests
<ul>
<li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>All your test files should be inside a folder tests</li>
<li>You have to use the unittest module</li>
<li>All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)</li>
<li>All your test files and folders should start with test_</li>
<li>Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py</li>
<li>All your tests should be executed by using this command: <code>python3 -m unittest discover tests</code></li>
<li>You can also test file by file by using this command: <code>python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py</code></li>
<li>We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case</li>
<ul>
